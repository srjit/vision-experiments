\begin{abstract}
In this experiment we studied a very important physical effect by measuring the
dependence of a quantity $V$ of the quantity $X$ for two different sample
temperatures.  Our experimental measurements confirmed the quadratic dependence
$V = kX^2$ predicted by Someone's first law. The value of the mystery parameter
$k = 15.4\pm 0.5$~s was extracted from the fit. This value is
not consistent with the theoretically predicted $k_{theory}=17.34$~s. We attribute this
discrepancy to low efficiency of our $V$-detector.

\subsection{Grayscale Conversion}

Here give a brief summary of the physical effect of interest and provide
necessary equations. Here is how you insert an equation. According to
references~\cite{melissinos, Cyr, Wiki} the dependence of interest is given
by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:aperp} % the label is used to reference the equation
u(\lambda,T)=\frac{8\pi hc\lambda^{-5}}{e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1},
\end{equation}
where T is temperature in Kelvin, c is the speed of light, etc. Don't forget to
explain what each variable means the first time that you introduce it.
